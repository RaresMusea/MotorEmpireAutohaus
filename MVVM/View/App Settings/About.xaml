Motor Empire is listed as a vehicle and auto parts supplier since 2015, but the digitalization of our business started in 2018 when the development team started working on the cross-platform application titled 'Motor Empire Autohaus'. Digitalization and the implicit move of our business to the online environment has led to a considerable increase in sales and popularity of the platform as well as the business, with MotorEmpire managing in less than 3 years of existence to compete with well-known car dealers in the online market such as Autovit, or even Mobile.De." />
